Open the KCM map and drag the window divider to the right to expose the 3D view.

Drag with RIGHT MOUSE
Zoom with MOUSE WHEEL

LEFT MOUSE CLICK -> Select vertex - it's height will be displayed in the right window and it's point
will become red.
CTRL + MOUSE CLICK -> selects multiple vertices by adding them together 1 by 1. If the vertex is already selected, it deselects it.
SHIFT + MOUSE DRAG -> selects multiple vertices by dragging across them.
CTRL + SHIFT + MOUSE DRAG -> you may select more rectangles of vertices at the same time.

+/- buttons -> raising/lowering terrain by the number of points set in the spinner below.
The height text field -> you may change the height of all the selected vertices by pressing ENTER.


**Future plans**

- opl integration (model placement/rotation/scaling)
- editing the color of the terrain
- editing textures on the terrain


**Changelog**

	- added multiselecting of vertices (ctrl, shift and ctrl+shift modes)
	- changed the height field and +/- buttons so they are more flexible.
