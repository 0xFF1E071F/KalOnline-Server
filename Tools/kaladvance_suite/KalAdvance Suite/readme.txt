- Archive -
-----------

Archive should contains:
-Launcher Directory (KalAdvance Launcher)
-Visual Editor(KalAdvance Launcher Visual Editor)
-rt_libs.rar (runtime package's))

-------------------
- Troubleshooting -
-------------------
If u have problem with running any application (missing vcl), just unpack rt_libs.rar to "(WIN32)/system32/" or to folder with this program. Should works :P That programs are compiled with vcl packages but my Delphi 5 sometimes didnt include libaries to .exe (strange :P )
