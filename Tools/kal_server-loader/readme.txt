What is does:
Well its a 1 click loader for any server hoster just run the app and the server will open in one windows instead of 3 with an added option of viewing/editing the server configs without having to dig up the directory.

We had a problem with the kosp version of MainsvrT.exe because of the splash screen when it first loads so we added a button you can click to put the MainsvrT.exe in the Kal-Server Loader once its loaded pasted the splash..If you wont use Kosp you wont have this problem. See the attached image to see the program and the buttom you need to press if running Kosp.

You will need to rename your server exe's to:
Login.exe
Database.exe
MainSvrT.exe

Then unzip the Kal-Server Loader to your server directory.
