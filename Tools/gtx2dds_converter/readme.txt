BakaBug's GTX2DDS and DDS2GTX

Jap Jap how it works.. hm good question :D

drag 1 GTX (or more but not more than 20 ..) over GTX2DDS.exe .. and boom you have a  DSS in the folder of GTX2DDS  :D

You can open this DDS  with XnView ! You also can save it as BMP and edit than :D
than you open the edited BMP with XnView save it as DDS

drag the DDS over DDS2GTX.exe and boom you have a GTX in the folder of DDS2GTX :D

You can copy your edited GTX  over the ori GTX and .. kal should load than your GTX (maybe)
